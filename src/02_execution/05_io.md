# Executors and System IO(执行器和系统IO)

In the previous section on [The `Future` Trait], we discussed this example of
a future that performed an asynchronous read on a socket:

<p class="cn">
在前面的[Future特征]部分中，我们讨论了在套接字上执行异步读取的future示例：
</p>

```rust,ignore
{{#include ../../examples/02_02_future_trait/src/lib.rs:socket_read}}
```

This future will read available data on a socket, and if no data is available,
it will yield to the executor, requesting that its task be awoken when the
socket becomes readable again. However, it's not clear from this example how
the `Socket` type is implemented, and in particular it isn't obvious how the
`set_readable_callback` function works. How can we arrange for `wake()`
to be called once the socket becomes readable? One option would be to have
a thread that continually checks whether `socket` is readable, calling
`wake()` when appropriate. However, this would be quite inefficient, requiring
a separate thread for each blocked IO future. This would greatly reduce the
efficiency of our async code.

<p class="cn">
此future将读取套接字上的可用数据，如果没有可用数据，它将向执行器屈服，请求在套接字再次变为可读时唤醒其任务。
然而，从这个示例中不清楚“Socket”类型是如何实现的，尤其是`set_readable_callback`函数是如何工作的。
一旦套接字变得可读，我们如何调度调用`wake()`？一种选择是让一个线程不断检查“socket”是否可读，并在适当的时候调用`wake()`。
然而，这将非常低效，需要为每个阻塞的IO Future使用单独的线程。这将大大降低异步代码的效率。
</p>

In practice, this problem is solved through integration with an IO-aware
system blocking primitive, such as `epoll` on Linux, `kqueue` on FreeBSD and
Mac OS, IOCP on Windows, and `port`s on Fuchsia (all of which are exposed
through the cross-platform Rust crate [`mio`]). These primitives all allow
a thread to block on multiple asynchronous IO events, returning once one of
the events completes. In practice, these APIs usually look something like
this:

<p class="cn">
实际上，通过与IO感知系统阻塞原语的集成，可以解决此问题，例如Linux上的“epoll”、FreeBSD和Mac OS上的“kqueue”、Windows上的IOCP和Fuchsia上的“port”（所有这些都是通过跨平台的Rust crate[‘mio’]提供）。这些原语都允许线程阻塞多个异步IO事件，并在其中一个事件完成后返回。实际上，这些API通常如下所示：
</p>

```rust,ignore
struct IoBlocker {
    /* ... */
}

struct Event {
    // An ID uniquely identifying the event that occurred and was listened for.
    id: usize,

    // A set of signals to wait for, or which occurred.
    signals: Signals,
}

impl IoBlocker {
    /// Create a new collection of asynchronous IO events to block on.
    fn new() -> Self { /* ... */ }

    /// Express an interest in a particular IO event.
    fn add_io_event_interest(
        &self,

        /// The object on which the event will occur
        io_object: &IoObject,

        /// A set of signals that may appear on the `io_object` for
        /// which an event should be triggered, paired with
        /// an ID to give to events that result from this interest.
        event: Event,
    ) { /* ... */ }

    /// Block until one of the events occurs.
    fn block(&self) -> Event { /* ... */ }
}

let mut io_blocker = IoBlocker::new();
io_blocker.add_io_event_interest(
    &socket_1,
    Event { id: 1, signals: READABLE },
);
io_blocker.add_io_event_interest(
    &socket_2,
    Event { id: 2, signals: READABLE | WRITABLE },
);
let event = io_blocker.block();

// prints e.g. "Socket 1 is now READABLE" if socket one became readable.
println!("Socket {:?} is now {:?}", event.id, event.signals);
```

Futures executors can use these primitives to provide asynchronous IO objects
such as sockets that can configure callbacks to be run when a particular IO
event occurs. In the case of our `SocketRead` example above, the
`Socket::set_readable_callback` function might look like the following pseudocode:

<p class="cn">
future执行器可以使用这些原语来提供异步IO对象，例如套接字，这些套接字可以配置回调以在特定IO事件发生时运行。
在上面的“SocketRead”示例中，`Socket::set_readable_callback`函数可能类似于以下伪代码：
</p>

```rust,ignore
impl Socket {
    fn set_readable_callback(&self, waker: Waker) {
        // `local_executor` is a reference to the local executor.
        // this could be provided at creation of the socket, but in practice
        // many executor implementations pass it down through thread local
        // storage for convenience.
        let local_executor = self.local_executor;

        // Unique ID for this IO object.
        let id = self.id;

        // Store the local waker in the executor's map so that it can be called
        // once the IO event arrives.
        local_executor.event_map.insert(id, waker);
        local_executor.add_io_event_interest(
            &self.socket_file_descriptor,
            Event { id, signals: READABLE },
        );
    }
}
```

We can now have just one executor thread which can receive and dispatch any
IO event to the appropriate `Waker`, which will wake up the corresponding
task, allowing the executor to drive more tasks to completion before returning
to check for more IO events (and the cycle continues...).

<p class="cn">
我们现在可以只有一个执行器线程，它可以接收任何IO事件并将其发送到相应的`Waker`，唤醒相应的任务，
允许执行器在返回检查更多IO事件之前驱动更多任务完成（循环继续…）。
